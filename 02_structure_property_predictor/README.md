# Structure–Property Predictor

## Overview
This project explores how structural or molecular descriptors can be used to predict material properties using data-driven methods. The focus is on understanding structure–property relationships rather than optimization.

## Methods
- Extraction of simplified structural descriptors
- Regression-based property prediction
- Trend visualization to assess correlations between structure and properties

## Results
The model identifies relationships between structural features and predicted properties, emphasizing trend discovery and interpretability.

## Research Relevance
Structure–property relationships are fundamental to polymers, biomaterials, nanomaterials, and computational materials science. This project demonstrates an early-stage computational approach to materials discovery.

## Future Work
- Expand descriptor sets
- Apply to experimental datasets
- Integrate physics-informed constraints
