# Mykhailo's Projects
#Engineering, AI, and Scientific Computing Projects

This repository contains a small set of independent projects focused on applying engineering fundamentals, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence to problems in healthcare, chemical engineering, and materials science.

These projects emphasize physical intuition, modeling, and data-driven insight rather than black-box solutions. They were developed independently to complement formal coursework and to demonstrate preparation for graduate-level research in engineering and applied sciences.

## Projects Included
- Medical Imaging Detection
- Diffusion–Reaction Simulator
- Structure–Property Predictor
