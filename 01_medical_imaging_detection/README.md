# Medical Imaging Detection

## Overview
This project applies image processing and basic machine learning techniques to analyze medical images and extract clinically relevant features. The goal is to demonstrate how computational methods can assist in medical image interpretation.

## Methods
- Image preprocessing including filtering and normalization
- Feature extraction using intensity- and edge-based methods
- Visualization of detected regions
- Implemented in Python using standard scientific computing libraries

## Results
The model highlights regions of interest in medical images and demonstrates how algorithmic choices influence detection outcomes. Emphasis is placed on interpretability rather than accuracy alone.

## Research Relevance
Medical imaging is a key application area for biomedical engineering and AI in healthcare. This project demonstrates foundational skills relevant to biomedical image processing and computer-aided diagnosis.

## Future Work
- Extend to larger and more diverse datasets
- Integrate supervised learning models
- Validate results against labeled clinical data
