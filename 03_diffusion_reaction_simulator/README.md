# Diffusion–Reaction Simulator

## Overview
This project models coupled diffusion and reaction processes using numerical simulation. It is motivated by transport phenomena problems commonly encountered in chemical engineering, materials science, and biological systems.

## Methods
- Finite-difference numerical solution of diffusion–reaction equations
- Parameter sweeps for diffusion coefficient and reaction rate
- Visualization of concentration profiles over space and time

## Results
The simulations demonstrate how diffusion and reaction compete under different conditions, providing physical intuition for system behavior and sensitivity.

## Research Relevance
Diffusion–reaction systems appear in polymer membranes, drug delivery, catalysis, and reaction engineering. This project reflects preparation for graduate-level coursework and research in transport phenomena and computational modeling.

## Future Work
- Extend to two- or three-dimensional systems
- Introduce nonlinear reaction kinetics
- Compare numerical solutions with analytical models
